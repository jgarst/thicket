Thicket
=======
*Personal note taking software for recording and collating densely connected ideas.*

Thicket can be used to take notes as you work, and will create a wiki like resource that is:

- Entirely text, can be managed in source control.
- Finely interlinked and quoted, with no broken links.
- Easy to browse, easy to extend.
- Structured for external tools.

Currently there is nothing here, and you shouldn't use it.
The code is a default sphinx project that is finding itself.
I encourage you to investigate Obsidian_ or Roam_ if the idea is appealing to you.


====
Plan
====

- Define a custom role for links to documents.

    - https://doughellmann.com/blog/2010/05/09/defining-custom-roles-in-sphinx/

- List all backlinks at the bottom of all documents.
- Create restrictions on how documents should be structured.  Enforce them with linters.

    - There is a daily-notes page named with today's date.
    - Referenced documents always exist.

- Extend backlinks to support section level anchors.
- Support transclusion and other poorly named ideas.
- Create a graph visualization for notes.


===================
Potential Use Cases
===================

- Can I create a Thicket that is a valuable artifact for someone else?
- Can I create a workshop or tutorial in Thicket?
- Can I embed flashcards, versioned information, or other structured data in Thicket?
- Can I create editor level tools to reduce the cognitive load of taking notes?

Why Not
=======
- Obsidian

   - Markdown is Calvinball, hard to extend, port and reuse.
   - I'm not thrilled with another electron app in my life.
   - Plugin API not finalized / Immature.

- Roam

   - Proprietary markdown is especially Calvinball
   - Their site does not appear to be holding it together
   - Our Beautiful Journey incoming

- MediaWiki

   - One of my primary goals is to not require a database.
   - The `Labeled Section Transclusion`_ extension exists.

- Tiddlywiki

   - A single file application makes it difficult to access and reuse structured information.
   - A lot of tiddlywiki's goals are similar to mine.

- Your Favorite Wiki

   - Is probably more interested in providing a complete application than a html representation of a set of files.
   - Thicket wants to be maintained in source control.  Your favorite wiki probably doesn't.

- Notion

   - Transclusion might be supported but isn't yet.
   - Intended for enterprise and not for me.
   - Probably not getting my data and workflow out in one piece.
